        In web design, page elements with the CSS float property applied to them
        are just like the images in the print layout where the text flows around
        them. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This
        is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute
        positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the
        flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told
        to ignore the page wrap. Absolutely positioned page elements will not
        affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect
        them, whether they touch each other or not.
